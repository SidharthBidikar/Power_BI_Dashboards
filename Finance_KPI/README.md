🚀 **Power BI Portfolio Project: Finance KPI Dashboard** 📊  

**Another step forward in my data analytics journey! This Power BI dashboard showcases key insights into financial performance.** This project helped me enhance my expertise in **Power BI, DAX, and data modeling**, while also deepening my understanding of **financial KPIs and variance analysis**.  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  

🔹 **Title:** Finance KPI Dashboard  
🔹 **Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX  
🔹 **Data Source:** Multiple Excel Tables (Actuals, Targets, Calendar, People)  

### 🎯 **Problem Statement**  
A finance team needed a **comprehensive performance tracking system** to analyze **monthly sales, revenue targets, and variance trends** across different sales representatives. The goal was to **track key financial KPIs, identify underperforming areas, and drive data-driven decision-making**.  

### 🎯 **Objectives**  
📍 Compare **actual vs. target performance**  
📍 Analyze **monthly and year-to-date (YTD) sales trends**  
📍 Measure **variance percentage & growth trends**  
📍 Visualize **team-level performance & sales rep efficiency**  
📍 Provide **actionable insights for business improvement**  

### 📊 **Insights & Visualizations**  
✔️ **KPI Metrics** – Total Sales, Variance %, Year-to-Date Performance  
✔️ **Monthly Trends** – Performance tracking over 14 months  
✔️ **Variance Analysis** – Understanding **target shortfalls & exceeded goals**  
✔️ **Sentiment Indicators** – Conditional formatting with 🔴🟢 indicators for variance  
✔️ **Dynamic Filtering** – Drill-downs by salesperson, region, and month  

### 🔍 **Key Recommendations**  
🔹 **Improve Target Achievement** – Only **2 out of 14 months** met targets. A **revised sales strategy** and training programs for underperforming months are needed.  
🔹 **Leverage Historical Trends** – Using **YTD analysis**, teams can **forecast revenue shortfalls** and **adjust goals proactively**.  
🔹 **Optimize Sales Rep Performance** – Individual sales rep analysis showed **gaps in target fulfillment**. Personalized coaching plans can improve outcomes.  
🔹 **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Using **DAX calculations for trend analysis**, the finance team can **track month-over-month performance** and **set realistic benchmarks**.  
🔹 **Interactive Reporting** – The dashboard’s **filters, slicers, and sparkline visualizations** enable managers to **drill down into team performance & financial trends easily**.
