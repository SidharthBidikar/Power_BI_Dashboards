🚀 **Power BI Portfolio Project: Call Center Performance Analysis** 📊  

Hello Everyone! I am excited to share that I completed a new **Power BI dashboard project** focused on **Call Center Performance Analysis**. This project enhanced my technical expertise in **Power BI and DAX**, while also helping me understand **customer service efficiency and sentiment analysis**.  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  

🔹 **Title:** Call Center Performance Analysis  
🔹 **Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX  
🔹 **Data Source:** Excel CSV files  

### 🎯 **Problem Statement**  
A call center wanted to **analyze its operational efficiency** to improve response time, customer satisfaction, and service quality. The key focus was on **understanding call volume, response times, customer sentiment, and issue categories** to enhance the overall support experience.  

### 🎯 **Objectives**  
📍 Identify peak call volume periods to **optimize staffing levels**  
📍 Analyze **response time trends** to improve SLA compliance  
📍 Examine **customer sentiment** to enhance service quality  
📍 Evaluate **call reasons and resolution efficiency**  
📍 Compare **performance across multiple call centers and channels**  

### 📊 **Insights & Visualizations**  
✔️ **KPI Metrics** – Total Calls (4.3K), Avg Call Duration (24.89 min), Response Time (75.2%)  
✔️ **Call Volume Trends** – Calls by Day, City, and State  
✔️ **Customer Sentiment Analysis** – Breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative interactions  
✔️ **Issue Categorization** – Most common call reasons (Billing, Payments, Service Issues)  
✔️ **Performance by Call Channel** – Call Center, Chatbot, Email, and Web comparisons  

### 🔍 **Key Recommendations**  
🔹 **Improve Response Time** – Since **only 75.2% of calls meet SLA**, additional training or AI-driven chatbots can enhance efficiency.  
🔹 **Optimize Staffing Based on Peak Hours** – Calls are **evenly distributed across the week**, but some days see a slight increase. Dynamic scheduling can **prevent long wait times**.  
🔹 **Enhance Self-Service Options** – Billing-related queries dominate, suggesting an opportunity to **improve FAQ sections or automate chatbot responses**.  
🔹 **Sentiment Analysis for Quality Control** – **1,424 negative sentiment calls** indicate a need for **better conflict resolution strategies**.  
🔹 **Channel-Specific Improvements** – Analyzing performance variations between **call center, chatbot, email, and web** can help **optimize multi-channel support strategies**.  

This project was an eye-opener in understanding **customer service analytics** and further refining my **data storytelling skills** using Power BI. 🚀
